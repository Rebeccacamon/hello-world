Hi Students!

My name is Rebecca and I am from Atlanta, Ga. I have my Bacheor's Degree in Cybersecurity and am currently enrolled for my masters degree. I love maming people laugh and laughing. I also really enjoy being outdoors. My passion is to help others see their true potential and inspire people to be the best versions of themselves. I am excited to be here.
